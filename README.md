# Digital electronics 2 final project : Autonomous-carpet



## Project objectives :

The project has for goal to implement a code in C language on an ATmega328PB in a small car in order to make the car autonomous on tracks

Here is the flowchart of our project



## Hardware components :

ATmega328PB : microcontroller
CP2102/9 : a bus between UART and USB (for putty results)
LSM9DS1 : inertial module that combine gyroscope, accellerometer and magnetometer
TLE5206 : driver for motors
A car
